# CMMI_Coding_Assignment

This repo contains Kaggle notebooks for Coding Assignment "Stereo‑Vision Boat Detection, Depth Estimation & Geo‑Tracking"

It is highly recommended to run all notebookes on Kaggle platform. Here are the main steps:

1. Go to "File", then "Import notebook" and select "CMMI_assignment.ipynb"
2. Go to "Settings" and then to the "Accelerator" and select "GPU P100"
3. You need to upload the assignment data:
 2.1 Go to Sidebar, "Input" and click "Upload", then choose "Assignment_Data_Coding_Exercise_06_2025.zip"
 2.2 Put the name for the assignment data: "marina-stereo-vision-vessel-images-full", 
  thus the path for the assignment data must be: "/kaggle/input/marina-stereo-vision-vessel-images-full"
4. You need to upload the validaton dataset:
 3.1 Go to Sidebar, "Input" and click "Upload", then choose "Validation_dataset.zip"
 3.2 Put the name for the validation data: "marina-validation-200", 
  thus the path for the assignment data must be: "/kaggle/input/marina-validation-200"
5. Run cells from top, one to one
